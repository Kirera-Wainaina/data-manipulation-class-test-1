    "# ITNPBD2, Representing and Manipulating Data\n",
    "## Class Test Spring 2024\n",
    "## Manipulating Basic Data Types in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This 'class test' is to be carried out online, not in a classroom. Students must complete the test by typing code and comments into the cells in the notebook below.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must enter both code and comments, as requested in the questions. In class, you will have been taught to plan your code using comments first. If you cannot produce working code in some places, then make sure you include comments that outline the algorithm you would use. You will get marks for knowing how to approach the problem even if your code does not fully work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important: You must work alone\n",
    "You must complete the test on your own. Do not work or communicate with other people while taking the test. Colluding with others is a form of academic misconduct and can cause you to fail the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important: You may NOT use any AI tool\n",
    "This test is designed to assess your ability to write code quickly without reference to tools such as artificial intelligence code generators. You must not use tools like GPT or Copilot. All the code must be written by you and you alone. Use of generative artificial intelligence in assessment is plagiarism, which is a form of academic misconduct and can cause you to fail the module.\n",

    "## Submission\n",

    "\n",
    "## Marking Criteria\n",
    "There are not separate marks for each question. Your overall mark will be determined by the overall quality of both your **code** and **comments** with reference to the University common marking scheme. The table below describes the broad classes of attainment required for each grade band.\n",
    "\n",
    "|Grade|Requirement|\n",
    "|:---|:---|\n",
    "| Fail | You will fail if your code does not run or does not achieve even the basics of the task. You may also fail if you submit code without either comments or a text explanation of what the code does.|\n",
    "| Pass | To pass, you must submit sufficient working code to show that you have mastered the basics of the task, even if not everything works completely. You may also pass if the parts of your submission that do not work have sensible comments that outline the algorithm. |\n",
    "| Merit | For a merit, your code must be mostly correct, with only small problems or parts missing, and your comments must be useful rather than simply re-stating the code in English. Most choices for methods and structures should be explained and alternatives mentioned. |\n",
    "| Distinction | For a distinction, your code must be working, correct, and well commented and shows an appreciation of style, efficiency and reliability. All choices for methods and structures are concisely justified and alternatives are given well thought considerations. For a distinction, your work should be of professional quality.|\n",
